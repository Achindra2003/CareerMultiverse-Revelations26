## 🎬 Demo Flow

### 1. Create Your Profile
```
Name: Alex Kumar
CGPA: 8.5
Skills: Python, JavaScript, React
Target Role: Software Engineer
```

### 2. Generate Your First Reality
```
Prompt: "I want to become a Full-Stack Developer at a product-based company"
```

AI generates:
- Learning resources (courses, books, platforms)
- Interview prep (150 LeetCode problems, 5 mock interviews)
- Timeline (9 months, 3 phases)
- Placement outcomes (CTC: 12-18L, companies: Google, Microsoft)

### 3. Fork & Compare
```
Fork → "Data Science Path"
Prompt: "I want to become a Data Scientist"
```

Compare:
- Software Dev: 9 months, React + Node.js
- Data Science: 12 months, Python + ML libraries

### 4. Merge
```
Merge → "Full-Stack Data Engineer"
```

Resolve conflicts:
- Time: 21 months combined → Optimize to 15 months
- Skills: Combine Python + SQL + React

### 5. Rollback
```
Click any previous reality → Instant rollback
```
